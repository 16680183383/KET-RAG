{"result": "The incident involving **QS三厂 (QS Plant 3)** and the **ECC系统M通道试验不合格事件 (ECC System M-Channel Test Failure Incident)** occurred at **Unit 2 of QS Plant 3** during a routine testing procedure. Specifically, the event took place while conducting standard evaluations of the **ECC (Emergency Core Cooling) system**, a critical safety mechanism in nuclear facilities. During the M-channel test—a component of the broader ECC system checks—the results were deemed **non-compliant with safety or operational standards**, prompting further investigation. Both descriptions confirm the location (Unit 2 of QS Plant 3) and the context (routine testing), with the first providing additional specificity about the ECC system focus. No contradictions exist between the descriptions; the second statement is a generalized version of the first. The incident underscores potential operational or technical irregularities in the plant's safety protocols.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
