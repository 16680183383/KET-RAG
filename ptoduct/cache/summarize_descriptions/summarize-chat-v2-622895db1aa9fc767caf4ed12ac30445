{"result": "**ECC系统M通道试验不合格事件**  \nOn November 15, 2024, an incident occurred during SRST-503M testing of the ECC system's M-channel (designated as P201). The issue was traced to a malfunctioning delay relay (identified as 63432-RL-5001M), which caused an unintended entry into Technical Specification (TS) operational restrictions. Both descriptions confirm that the faulty relay directly led to the unplanned operational constraints, highlighting the critical role of component reliability in system testing. The event underscores the need for rigorous quality control of relay components in the ECC system's M-channel infrastructure. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions; they collectively emphasize the relay failure as the root cause and its operational consequences.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
